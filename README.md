# Chrome Extension - DevOps Adjust Layout

Chrome extension to move the "bolt" pane to the right sidebar

## How to use

I don't plan to submit this extension to Chromes store. You can use it as a developer:

1. Clone this repo
1. In your browser, visit: chrome://extensions/
1. Check "Developer mode" in the upper right corner
1. Choose "Load unpacked" and select the repo folder
